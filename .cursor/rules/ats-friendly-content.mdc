# ATS-Friendly Content Guidelines

## Resume Content Standards

### Section Headings
- Use standard, ATS-friendly section headings in PDF exports:
  - `Work Experience` (not "Job Dungeons")
  - `Technical Skills` (not "Power Ups")
  - `Projects` (not "Project Logs")
  - `Development Tools` (not "Tool Kit")
  - `Education` (not "Edu Quest")
  - `Languages` (not "Spell Book")
  - `Interests` (not "Side Quests")

### Content Writing Guidelines

1. **Action Verbs**: Always start bullet points with strong action verbs:
   - Architected, Developed, Implemented, Built, Designed, Led, Optimized, Created, Delivered

2. **Quantifiable Achievements**: Include metrics and numbers where possible:
   - Team size (e.g., "Led team of 5 engineers")
   - Performance improvements (e.g., "Improved performance by 30%")
   - User metrics (e.g., "Used by millions of users")
   - Crash-free rates (e.g., "Maintained 99% crash-free rate")

3. **Technology Keywords**: Include relevant technology names naturally:
   - React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, AWS, Cloudflare
   - Use full names (e.g., "React Native" not "RN")
   - Include version numbers only when relevant

4. **Industry-Specific Terms**: Use standard industry terminology:
   - "Full-stack development" not "full stack dev"
   - "CI/CD pipelines" not "ci/cd"
   - "State management" not "state mgmt"
   - "Performance optimization" not "perf opt"

5. **ATS-Friendly Formatting**:
   - Use standard date formats: "2024-06" (YYYY-MM)
   - Spell out abbreviations on first use
   - Use consistent capitalization
   - Avoid special characters that might break parsing

### Content Structure

- **Work Experience**: Focus on achievements, impact, and technologies used
- **Skills**: Group logically, include proficiency levels
- **Projects**: Highlight technologies, challenges solved, and outcomes
- **Tools**: List development tools and platforms used

### Keywords to Include

For frontend/full-stack roles, ensure these keywords appear naturally:
- React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js
- State Management, Performance Optimization
- WebSocket, GraphQL, REST APIs
- CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Docker
- AWS, Cloudflare, Supabase
- Security, Compliance, Enterprise Applications
