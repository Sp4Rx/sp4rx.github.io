# Commit Message Guidelines

## Commit Message Standards

### Format Structure
Follow conventional commit format when appropriate:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit Types
Use standard commit types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes

### Subject Line Rules

1. **Capitalize first letter**: Start with uppercase
2. **No period**: Don't end with a period
3. **Imperative mood**: Write as if completing "This commit will..."
   - ✅ "Add tools section to resume"
   - ❌ "Added tools section" or "Adding tools section"
4. **Keep it concise**: 50-72 characters ideal, max 100
5. **Be specific**: Describe what changed, not why

### Body (Optional but Recommended)

- Separate from subject with blank line
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues/PRs when relevant

### Footer (Optional)

- Reference issues: `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`
- Co-authors: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`

### Examples

**Good Commit Messages:**
```
feat(resume): add tools section with development tools

- Add tools array to resume data structure
- Create Tools section component with retro styling
- Update ResumeSection to handle Tools with ATS-friendly titles
- Include VS Code, Cursor, Xcode, Android Studio, etc.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(pdf): reduce excessive whitespace in generated PDF

Calculate PDF height based on actual content height instead of
document height to eliminate unnecessary whitespace at bottom.
```

```
refactor(resume): update freelance section for full-stack focus

- Change position title to emphasize full-stack capabilities
- Add backend services and database design to summary
- Update highlights to include Node.js, Python, and backend work
```

```
docs(rules): add ATS-friendly content guidelines

Create cursor rules for maintaining ATS-friendly resume content
including section headings, action verbs, and keyword usage.
```

**Bad Commit Messages:**
```
❌ "update"
❌ "fix bug"
❌ "changes"
❌ "WIP"
❌ "asdf"
❌ "Fixed the thing that was broken"
```

### Scope Guidelines

Use scope to indicate what part of the codebase changed:
- `resume`: Resume-related components/data
- `pdf`: PDF generation scripts
- `game`: Snake game logic
- `ui`: UI components
- `styles`: Styling changes
- `config`: Configuration files
- `docs`: Documentation

### Special Cases

**Breaking Changes:**
```
feat(api): change authentication method

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication now requires JWT tokens instead
of session cookies. Update client code accordingly.
```

**Multiple Changes:**
```
feat(resume): add tools section and update cursor rules

- Add tools section to resume data and UI
- Create cursor rules for commit messages and architecture
- Update ResumeSection component for Tools section
```

### Best Practices

1. **Commit often**: Small, focused commits are better than large ones
2. **One logical change per commit**: Don't mix unrelated changes
3. **Write for your future self**: Clear messages help with debugging
4. **Use present tense**: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
5. **Be descriptive**: Future you will thank present you
6. **Review before committing**: Read your message before finalizing

### Integration with Workflow

- Use clear commits for easier code reviews
- Better git history and `git blame` results
- Easier to revert specific changes
- Better changelog generation
- Improved collaboration with team
