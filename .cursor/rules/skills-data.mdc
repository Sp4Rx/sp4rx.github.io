# Skills Data Management Guidelines

## Skills Data Structure Standards

### Keyword Optimization Rules

1. **Limit Keywords Per Skill**:
   - Maximum **3-4 keywords** per skill item
   - Focus on the most important, ATS-relevant technologies
   - Remove redundant or less important keywords

2. **Keyword Selection Criteria**:
   - Prioritize technologies mentioned in job descriptions
   - Include industry-standard tools and frameworks
   - Remove duplicates (e.g., if "React" is in skill name, don't repeat in keywords)
   - Avoid generic terms unless they add ATS value

3. **ATS-Friendly Keywords**:
   - Use full technology names (e.g., "React Native" not "RN")
   - Include specific frameworks/libraries (e.g., "Redux", "Zustand")
   - Add relevant concepts (e.g., "Real-time Dashboards", "GraphQL Subscriptions")
   - Avoid overly generic terms unless necessary

### Skills Data Structure

```typescript
skills: [
  {
    group: "Category Name", // Clear, ATS-friendly category
    items: [
      {
        name: "Technology Name", // Main technology/framework
        level: 50-90, // Proficiency level (50-90 range)
        keywords?: string[] // Optional: 3-4 most important related technologies
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Best Practices

1. **Consistency**:
   - Keep keyword count consistent across similar skills
   - Use similar keyword patterns for related technologies
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions

2. **Relevance**:
   - Keywords should be directly related to the main skill
   - Focus on technologies that appear in job descriptions
   - Prioritize skills that demonstrate full-stack capabilities

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Review and update keywords when adding new job-relevant technologies
   - Remove outdated or less relevant keywords
   - Keep total keyword count manageable (3-4 per skill max)

4. **ATS Optimization**:
   - Keywords are hidden in PDF but visible on website
   - Ensure important technologies appear in skill names or coreSkills
   - Keywords supplement but don't replace main skill names

### Examples

**Good:**
```typescript
{
  name: "React JS",
  level: 90,
  keywords: ["React", "Redux", "Zustand", "Real-time Dashboards"]
}
```

**Bad (too many keywords):**
```typescript
{
  name: "React JS",
  level: 90,
  keywords: ["React", "TypeScript", "Redux", "Zustand", "State Management", "Real-time Dashboards", "Data Visualization", "Hooks", "Context API"]
}
```

**Bad (redundant keywords):**
```typescript
{
  name: "React Native",
  level: 80,
  keywords: ["React Native", "React", "JavaScript", "TypeScript"] // React Native already implies React
}
```

### When Adding New Skills

1. Check if technology already exists in another group
2. Limit keywords to 3-4 most important related technologies
3. Ensure keywords are ATS-friendly and job-relevant
4. Update `coreSkills` in `basics` if it's a major technology
5. Maintain consistency with existing skill structure
